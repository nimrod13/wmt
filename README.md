# Work Management Software Tool
Work Management Software Tool is a PHP/MySQL web application which provides an effective means of recording and monitoring work hours, storing this data for generating statistics on performance and reports containing either online or offline activity for users. 

It provides both an interface for regular operators (employees) and for administrators, offering managers the possibility of evaluating the productivity of their employees, by analyzing the amount of work done over a certain period of time, for instance.
